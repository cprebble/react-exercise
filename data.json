Now a few companies are betting that people who like Alexa in their homes will like it on the road, as well. But is an Alexa dongle for your car actually useful? I tested four Alexa add-on units to find out. The short answer: not yet.<\/p>\n<p>These add-ons vary slightly in design, but at their core, they\u2019re mostly the same type of device. You get a dongle that plugs into your car\u2019s accessory power (aka, cigarette lighter) jack and connects to your car stereo (either via aux cable or Bluetooth). It then wirelessly tethers to your smartphone for an Internet connection. From there, you can ask Alexa to check traffic, weather, and news; play music; control smart-home devices; answer basic search queries; and perform other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b?node=13727921011\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">simple skills<\/a>. Some have screens, others have a built-in speakers, still others have USB charging ports, but they all function similarly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-container option-b\">\n\t<aside class=\"newsletter option-b-newsletter in-shortcode\">\n\t<div class=\"newsletter-row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-newsletter\">\n\t\t\t<form name=\"inline-newsletter-option-b\" class=\"newsletter-form\" novalidate>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-tagline\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"heading\">Keep up with everything Wirecutter from your inbox<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-options\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"default\" checked=\"checked\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Wirecutter Weekly:<\/strong> New reviews and picks, sent weekly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"deals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Deals We Love:<\/strong> The best deals we can find, sent daily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-list\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease choose a newsletter to subscribe to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label for=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Sign up for Wirecutter's Newsletter<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" class=\"newsletter-source\" value=\"optionB\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"email\" class=\"newsletter-field newsletter-email\" placeholder=\"name@example.com\" value=\"\" name=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"newsletter-submit\">Subscribe<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-email field-error-general\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat wasn't a valid email address.

Once I plugged the Speak into my car\u2019s accessory-power port and tethered it to my iPhone\u2019s data connection via Bluetooth (it automatically reconnects as long as you haven\u2019t closed the Garmin app), in-car Alexa worked as expected. I was able to stream a podcast from TuneIn over Bluetooth, and with Garmin\u2019s Alexa skill, I got directions, both spoken and visible on the Speak\u2019s small display. I was even able to turn on a lamp in my apartment on my way home so I had the pleasure of coming home to a lit-up living room.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\"><div class=\"title\">Pull Quote<\/div><p>To be compelling, these gadgets need to be more than just \u201cAlexa in the car\u201d\u2014they have to be more useful than the phone you already have.<\/p><\/aside>\n<p>Unfortunately, because most of these Alexa add-on devices lack a built-in speaker, you can use them only while connected to your car\u2019s stereo system. That means that anytime you change the system input to listen to the radio, take a call, or listen to an unsupported streaming service, you have to manually change it back to the correct source before asking Alexa to do anything. This isn\u2019t a big issue if everything you want to listen to happens to be in the Alexa ecosystem, but that\u2019s rarely the case. None of these devices support Apple Music and few support Spotify as of this writing. (<a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/14177\/0\/4\/71598\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech\u2019s ZeroTouch<\/a> supports Spotify, but it works only with Android.)<\/p>\n<p>This brings us to the biggest issue: All of these devices need an iPhone 5 or later or an Android phone running Android OS 5.0 or later to function, so why wouldn\u2019t I just use my phone\u2019s built-in Siri or Google Assistant? For half the price of the cheapest Alexa add-on, I could buy <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-smartphone-car-mount\/\">our pick for the best smartphone car mount<\/a>, put my iPhone on it, and use Siri to get directions, send messages, take calls, listen to whatever I want on Apple Music, and more. Navigation would be better too because I could use any app I want and get full-screen navigation. Going with Alexa makes even less sense if your <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-car-stereos-with-apple-carplay-and-android-auto\/\">car stereo supports CarPlay or Android Auto<\/a>, which give you a full-screen display and voice control and are specifically designed to be used while driving, unlike Alexa (there are no directly Alexa-compatible car stereos right now).<\/p>\n<p>There are some tricks that Alexa can do that the other two can\u2019t, but not many. In particular, Alexa supports more <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-alexa-compatible-smart-home-devices-for-amazon-echo\/\">smart-home devices<\/a> than Google Assistant and HomeKit. This enables you to, for example, adjust your smart thermostat so it\u2019s comfortable by the time you get home. But, again, chances are you can already do these with your phone automatically via geofencing, so the tasks happen when you reach a set distance from your home. A lot of other Alexa\u2019s skills\u2014playing Jeopardy, ordering socks\u2014simply don\u2019t make sense to use while driving most of the time.<\/p>\n\n\t<figure id=\"attachment_36546\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n\t\t<img class=\"size-full wp-image-36546\" src=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2.jpg\" alt=\"The Anker Roav Viva in use in a car's center console.\" width=\"636\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2.jpg 636w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-630x420.jpg 630w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-570x380.jpg 570w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-330x220.jpg 330w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-200x134.jpg 200w, https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/alexacardevices-Roav-Viva-lowres-4649-2-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" \/>\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n\t\t\tAnker\u2019s Roav Viva is the most promising Alexa car device because of its USB-power ports and relatively low price.

But seriously, just wait. You can always buy it later if Alexa in the car proves to be useful at a later date\u2014there\u2019s no advantage to adopting early.<\/p>\n<p>If Alexa\u2019s car-appropriate skills improve, and these add-on Alexa dongles gain features such as built-in cellular connectivity and better integration with car stereos, we will revisit this advice. But to be compelling, these gadgets need to be more than just \u201cAlexa in the car.\u201d They have to be more useful than the phone you already have. We don\u2019t see that happening anytime soon.<\/p>\n",

The experts we interviewed\u2014including Dan Kieling (a 79-time marathoner), Stephen Regenold (founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/gearjunkie.com\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gear Junkie<\/a>), <a href=\"http:\/\/katiearnold.net\/bio\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Katie Arnold<\/a> (a competitive ultra runner, a contributing editor at Outside, and the author of a forthcoming memoir called <em>Running Home<\/em>), and Elinor Fish (founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/runwildretreats.com\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Run Wild Retreats + Wellness<\/a>)\u2014all pointed to the fact that many so-called running jackets prioritized weather resistance over breathability. A jacket that\u2019s not breathable isn\u2019t worth buying: It will trap your sweat under its sleeves, leaving you clammy, wet, and uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost runners\u2014myself included\u2014would sacrifice a certain amount of waterproofness in order to have better breathability,\u201d Fish wrote to us in an email. \u201cEspecially in cold weather, staying dry is key to staying comfortable. And if your jacket isn\u2019t sufficiently breathable, then it doesn\u2019t matter how sweat-wicking your next-to-skin layers and mid-layers are\u2014they will get drenched.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A jacket that\u2019s not breathable can also be a safety concern for runners. When you run, your sweat needs to evaporate in order to cool you off. If your jacket prevents your sweat from evaporating, it creates\u00a0a steamy microclimate that can cause you to overheat during a workout. In cold weather, trapped sweat can leave you with wet base layers\u2014and when you stop running, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princeton.edu\/~oa\/safety\/hypocold.shtml\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you\u2019ll be primed for hypothermia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo company has cracked the nut for a waterproof and breathable jacket made for running and other high-output sports,\u201d Stephen Regenold said. \u201cThe technology is just not there yet. Membranes and breathable fabrics simply cannot keep up with the sweat and heat produced by a human running. After many years of trying to find a running jacket that works perfectly, I have given up. Nothing can wick sweat fast enough; I am <em>always<\/em> soaked from the inside out after a run.\u201d<\/p>\n",

Using nothing but your voice, you can ask both to play music, get news updates, set timers, and control popular smart-home devices. They can also answer an ever-increasing variety of questions. If you\u2019re shopping for your first smart speaker, we think the Echo Dot is a slightly better value, but a lot of \u201cit depends\u201d concerns are involved in that recommendation.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest difference between the Echo Dot and the Home Mini are the platforms that enable them to work their magic. The Echo Dot runs on Amazon\u2019s Alexa platform, and the Home Mini runs on Google Assistant. If you already own devices that support either platform, the decision is easy: Stick with the platform you already chose, because these things work better in groups. Whether that\u2019s the ability to play the same song or podcast simultaneously in multiple locations (a feature called multiroom audio) or the ability to serve as a home intercom system, the more the merrier.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nIf you haven\u2019t picked a platform yet, we go into more detail on the platforms individually in our <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/amazon-echo-vs-google-home\/\">Echo vs. Google Home<\/a> speaker comparison to help you decide.

Amazon made the Echo Dot a little easier to use than previous models by adding actual buttons on the top, so even someone new to the device will be able to figure out how to turn off the microphone or control the volume. The Home Mini also lets you control it by tapping, but the device has no obvious visible buttons, so you have to know what you\u2019re doing. This may not be important after you\u2019ve lived with the Home Mini for a while, but the knowledge is helpful when guests come over.<\/p>\n<p>The Home Mini\u2019s larger and louder speaker beats that of the Echo Dot in out-of-the-box sound quality\u2014although to be fair, they both sound pretty terrible on their own as music devices. If you expect to use your smart speaker primarily for listening to music, you\u2019re better off upgrading to the larger and better-sounding <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/22641\/0\/4\/70919\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Echo<\/a> or full-size\u00a0<a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/16129\/0\/4\/70920\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Home<\/a>. Either of those models would work well as an office or kitchen speaker because both have good enough sound quality and are clearly audible from across the room.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you already have a set of speakers you like, the Echo Dot is the better option because it can connect wirelessly to any Bluetooth speaker. It also has a 3.5 mm output jack to connect to a non-wireless audio system with a cable. I have one wired into my home theater receiver, which plays through a 7.2 speaker system. A recent update also allows any Alexa device to control any existing Sonos speakers you might have (although this feature doesn\u2019t support all music services, which we touch upon in our <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/sonos-one\/\">Sonos One review<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The Home Mini does not offer Bluetooth output, nor does it have a wired audio-output option. However, if you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-chromecast-speaker\/\">Chromecast speaker<\/a>, such as the <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/20631\/0\/4\/70921\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">JBL Playlist<\/a>, or <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/6314\/0\/4\/70922\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chromecast Audio dongles<\/a> connected to a sound system, you can cast the Home Mini\u2019s sound output to that speaker via Wi-Fi. Casting (that is, streaming via Chromecast) is better than nothing, but it\u2019s not as commonplace as using Bluetooth or a cable.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in smart home control, find out which system the devices you already own will work with. For instance, if you have Philips Hue or LIFX lights, or Wemo or Lutron Cas\u00e9ta switches, you can go either way. If you have a Chamberlain MyQ garage-door controller, you\u2019re looking at a Google Home. Have a Kwikset Kevo door lock? You should choose Amazon Alexa. For a more complete rundown of how the systems stack up, check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/amazon-echo-vs-google-home\/\">full guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One last thing to consider is accessories. You can find more third-party <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_10?url=search-alias%3Damazon-devices&amp;field-keywords=echo+dot+accessories&amp;sprefix=echo+dot+a%2Camazon-devices%2C132&amp;tag=thewire06-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;ascsubtag=YT35409\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accessories for the Amazon Echo Dot<\/a>\u00a0than for the Google Home Mini. You can get battery backups, speaker boosters, and decorative skins all designed to fit the Echo Dot, largely because the Echo Dot has been available for longer and (according to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voicebot.ai\/amazon-echo-alexa-stats\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Edison\/NPR research report<\/a>) is more popular than the Home Mini, though you can find a few <a href=\"https:\/\/store.google.com\/product\/incipio_wall_mount\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wall mounts<\/a> for the Home Mini. We hope this will even out soon, but as of now the Echo Dot has a wider range of accessory options.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated on February 5, 2018, to add information on Google Home Mini accessory wall mounts.<\/em><\/p>\n",

At the time of this writing, Tide hasn\u2019t gotten back to us on which exact whitener. However, according to Tide, \u201cfor the vast majority of consumers it is not a problem,\u201d and the company has no plans to take the staining ingredient out. Because the problem isn\u2019t going away, and is maybe even getting worse with the rise of pods, we decided to dig a little deeper here.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-container option-b\">\n\t<aside class=\"newsletter option-b-newsletter in-shortcode\">\n\t<div class=\"newsletter-row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-newsletter\">\n\t\t\t<form name=\"inline-newsletter-option-b\" class=\"newsletter-form\" novalidate>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-tagline\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"heading\">Keep up with everything Wirecutter from your inbox<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-options\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"default\" checked=\"checked\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Wirecutter Weekly:<\/strong> New reviews and picks, sent weekly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"deals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Deals We Love:<\/strong> The best deals we can find, sent daily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-list\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease choose a newsletter to subscribe to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label for=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Sign up for Wirecutter's Newsletter<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" class=\"newsletter-source\" value=\"optionB\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"email\" class=\"newsletter-field newsletter-email\" placeholder=\"name@example.com\" value=\"\" name=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"newsletter-submit\">Subscribe<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-email field-error-general\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat wasn't a valid email address.

He researches washing machines. I research laundry detergent. Naturally, we talk. The confusing and often conflicting information on how much laundry detergent to use is a favorite topic of conversation. Washing machine companies say one thing, laundry detergent companies say quite another.<\/p>\n<p>For example, McCabe reports that LG, the makers of many washing machines, recommends that the maximum amount of laundry detergent you should use for 25 pounds of laundry in a high-efficiency machine is <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/the-best-washer-and-dryer\/#use-less-detergent-and-other-tips-for-your-modern-washer\">2 tablespoons<\/a>. If you follow the washing instructions on a bottle of Tide, you would fill the cap up to level one for a medium load of laundry. I measured this amount. It\u2019s 3 tablespoons. <a href=\"https:\/\/tide.com\/en-us\/how-to-wash-clothes\/how-to-do-laundry\/how-do-i-know-load-size-for-my-washing-machine\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to the Tide website<\/a>, a medium load is 6 pounds of laundry.<\/p>\n<p>Are you seeing the problem here?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Washing machine manufacturer: 2 tablespoons for 25 pounds<\/li>\n<li>Laundry detergent maker: 3 tablespoons for 6 pounds<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Breaking down the ratios of detergent to laundry, Tide is telling you to use over six times the amount of detergent that the washing machine company is. <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/the-best-washer-and-dryer\/#use-less-detergent-and-other-tips-for-your-modern-washer\">McCabe found similar discrepancies<\/a>. As he says in the washing machine guide, \u201cnot a single HE-washer brand recommends using as much detergent as the detergent brands recommend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tide recommends using one Tide pod for a medium load of laundry. If P&amp;G has used a similar detergent-to-laundry ratio as they\u2019ve suggested for the liquid, this is probably too much detergent. But once it\u2019s packaged all pretty in a pod, you can\u2019t put in less. And staining isn\u2019t the only issue too much detergent can cause: <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/the-best-washer-and-dryer\/#use-less-detergent-and-other-tips-for-your-modern-washer\">According to washing machine companies and appliance repair people<\/a>, too much detergent can <a href=\"https:\/\/lakeappliancerepair.com\/blog\/what-happens-when-you-use-too-much-soap-in-your-washing-machine\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gunk up your machine<\/a>, and leave your clothes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rd.com\/home\/cleaning-organizing\/using-too-much-laundry-detergent\/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">feeling grimy and gross<\/a>.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\"><div class=\"title\">Pull Quote<\/div><p>Tide is telling you to use over six times the amount of detergent that the washing machine company is.<\/p><\/aside>\n<p>Beene told us that Tide figures out how much detergent to use \u201cbased off of our extensive testing across various machine models and wash conditions,\u201d and although it\u2019s something P&amp;G continues to tweak, the company has no current plans to change its recommendations\u2014and neither do we.<\/p>\n<p>For all the years our laundry detergent guide has existed, we\u2019ve never recommended pods. In our tests, they don\u2019t clean as well as liquids, their candy-like appearance poses a danger to children and to adults with cognitive difficulties, and they\u2019re more expensive per wash. The Tide Pods staining issue reinforces our decision on this. You may sidestep the staining issue with liquid Tide by using how much your washing machine recommends, rather than how much the bottle says. But in order to do that, you need to ditch the pods first. Your washing machine, clothes, and wallet will all thank you.<\/p>\n",

		"rendered": "<p>Some readers have been wondering where our guides to outdoor knives and ski and snowboard helmets have gone. We\u2019ve temporarily taken down the outdoor knives review because we found a problem with some of the reporting that was serious enough to prompt us to reexamine our recommendations, and we didn\u2019t want readers to purchase a product we weren\u2019t fully confident of. We discovered a potential similar issue with the helmets guide\u2014though we haven\u2019t confirmed it\u2014and we\u2019re checking that review as well. We will revise both guides thoroughly and repost them when we\u2019ve completed those processes.<\/p>\n<p><i>Update, January 12, 2018:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been looking into the issue over the last few days and we\u2019ve learned that the writer of those two guides had relied on a source who appears to have had business relationships with manufacturers whose products were included in our testing.<\/p>\n<p>For whatever reason, the writer did not uncover these relationships or disclose them to us during the editing process; nor did we discover them ourselves. They came up after publication when we began to track down some information that surfaced in comments from a reader with expertise in the field. While we can\u2019t say whether these relationships had an influence on the picks in either guide, we don\u2019t want to take the chance that they had any impact at all. <\/p>\n<p>Given that, we decided to pull the guides, and are researching and writing both again from scratch. We hope to repost as soon as we can.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for your help. We rely on our readers, and hope you can continue to rely on us.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-container option-b\">\n\t<aside class=\"newsletter option-b-newsletter in-shortcode\">\n\t<div class=\"newsletter-row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-newsletter\">\n\t\t\t<form name=\"inline-newsletter-option-b\" class=\"newsletter-form\" novalidate>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-tagline\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"heading\">Keep up with everything Wirecutter from your inbox<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-options\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"default\" checked=\"checked\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Wirecutter Weekly:<\/strong> New reviews and picks, sent weekly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"deals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Deals We Love:<\/strong> The best deals we can find, sent daily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-list\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease choose a newsletter to subscribe to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label for=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Sign up for Wirecutter's Newsletter<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" class=\"newsletter-source\" value=\"optionB\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"email\" class=\"newsletter-field newsletter-email\" placeholder=\"name@example.com\" value=\"\" name=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"newsletter-submit\">Subscribe<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-email field-error-general\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat wasn't a valid email address.

The brilliant thing about electric pressure cookers like the Instant Pot is that you can make dinner in under an hour with very little effort or attention. The results taste nearly as good as slow dinners made on the stove (sometimes better!), and you have only one pot to clean at the end.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>You can find plenty of impressive, but involved, Instant Pot recipes showcasing the best that electric pressure cookers have to offer. I\u2019ve made Melissa Clark\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/cooking.nytimes.com\/recipes\/1018552-pressure-cooker-spicy-pork-shoulder\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">spicy pulled pork<\/a> for a dinner party to rave reviews, as well as one from our own test kitchen for <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/blog\/pressure-cooker-recipe\/\">lemon chicken and vegetables<\/a>.

Add 1 pound chicken thighs, the other half of the poblano, any vegetable extras, and half of a jar of salsa if you want. <strong>Manual, high pressure, 20 minutes more.<\/strong> Quick release if you\u2019re hungry, natural if you forget about it. \u2014Tim Barribeau<\/p>\n<h4>Soy sauce chicken<\/h4>\n<p>Optional: Brown whole chicken in oil on <strong>Saut\u00e9.<\/strong> Add 4 cloves garlic, 2 star anise, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches of ginger sliced, \u00bd cup soy sauce, \u00bd cup brown sugar, 4 cups water. <strong>Manual, high pressure, 25 minutes.<\/strong> Quick release pressure. \u2014Ganda Suthivarakom<\/p>\n<h4>American-style chicken and vegetables<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Saut\u00e9<\/strong> (or simply add to the pot if you\u2019re short on time) about 4 cups\u2019 worth of veggies cut to roughly equal-size chunks with a drizzle of oil and salt and pepper. Potatoes, carrots, celery, mushrooms, onions, and garlic are all good options. Layer about 4 pounds of chicken leg quarters on top (thighs and breasts also work well, with or without bones), along with more salt and pepper and an optional bay leaf or other herbs if you\u2019d like. <strong>Manual, high pressure, 20 minutes (15 minutes if using boneless chicken).<\/strong> Natural release until it opens on its own (about 20 minutes). Optional: Garnish with chopped parsley.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variation 1, chicken and rice: Add 2 cups of rice and about 2 cups of chicken stock or other liquid (make 1 cup of it cream if you like it creamy).<\/li>\n<li>Variation 2, Instant Pot coq au vin: Make the main recipe but add about 4 slices of bacon, chopped, to your saut\u00e9 mix. Add a few glugs of red wine (up to half the bottle). Follow the same pressure instructions. \u2014Jacqui Cheng<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Tomato soup<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Saut\u00e9<\/strong> about 6 cloves of smashed garlic with a roughly chopped onion. Add 2 cans of whole tomatoes and their liquid and seasonings (oregano, thyme, salt). <strong>Manual, high pressure, 10 minutes.<\/strong> Quick or natural release. Blend with an immersion blender until smooth. Add fresh herbs, salt, and pepper to taste. \u2014Courtney Schley<\/p>\n<h3>Easy sides and bases<\/h3>\n<h4>Braised kale<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Saut\u00e9<\/strong> sliced bacon until the fat is rendered. Add sliced shiitakes and chopped garlic. Add 1 bunch kale, chopped, plus 3 chunked carrots and \u00bd cup water or broth. <strong>Manual, high pressure, 8 minutes.<\/strong> Quick release. \u2014GS<\/p>\n<h4>Rice pilaf<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Saut\u00e9<\/strong> \u00bc cup of broken-up spaghetti in 2 tablespoons of butter until the pasta is golden and fragrant. Add half of a medium onion, diced small, and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Follow with 1\u00bd cups basmati rice, 1\u00bd cups water, and a pinch of salt. Cover the pot and cook on <strong>Manual, high pressure, 6 minutes<\/strong>, then natural release for 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. \u2014Lesley Stockton<\/p>\n<h4>Coconut rice<\/h4>\n<p>Combine one 13.5-ounce can of coconut milk with 1\u2154 cups basmati rice, rinsed (or you can do 1 cup coconut milk, \u2154 cup water, and the same amount of rice, but all coconut milk will be richer). Throw in a big pinch of salt and (optional) 1 or 2 teaspoons of minced fresh ginger, and\/or 1 or 2 minced cloves of garlic. Cook using the <strong>Rice setting (no adjustments necessary),<\/strong> natural release 10 minutes. Stir in a handful of chopped cilantro if you want. \u2014Marguerite Preston<\/p>\n<h4>Chicken stock<\/h4>\n<p>Combine chicken drumsticks\/thighs and feet (or wings, or leftover bones, or whatever happens to be cheap), root vegetables, celery, garlic, onions, and any herbs you might like in the pot and add enough water to cover. <strong>Manual, high pressure, 90 minutes.<\/strong> Quick or natural release, then skim. \u2014TB<\/p>\n<p>Have a go-to shorty recipe for your Instant Pot?

		"rendered": "<p>In high school, I didn\u2019t have a scale in my house, but my friend Eliza did. A typical Saturday night for us was to eat a bunch of cookie dough and then marathon a season of <em>Friends<\/em>. When I used the bathroom at her house, I couldn\u2019t help but step on the scale. As soon as it registered my weight, I\u2019d realize my horrible mistake of ever going near sugar, and then return to the TV den and insist on doing crunches, as though I could remove all the fat I didn\u2019t want right then and there, while three women of varying degrees of \u201cextremely skinny\u201d engaged in hijinks on screen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe scale is bad news,\u201d says Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University. Weight fluctuates naturally, and people are just not good at taking the data a scale provides and using it to make rational choices.<\/p>\n<p>Say one day you exercise a lot, and then the scale declares that you\u2019ve gained half a pound. Feels bad, right? For all the overwhelming guilt or grim success a single measurement can make someone feel, each individual weigh-in is just not that meaningful\u2014carb intake, water retention, hormone levels, and even the amount of sleep you get can affect your day-to-day weight by as much as a few pounds.<\/p>\n<p>Ariely\u2019s proposed solution is the <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/24487\/0\/4\/70034\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shapa<\/a> (\u201cshape-ah\u201d), a scale without numbers. It looks like a small flying saucer, and in lieu of showing your weight in pounds or kilos, it has a glowing S in the middle that lights up in a color corresponding to how your weight is trending relative to the past three weeks, from gray to green to blue.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-container option-b\">\n\t<aside class=\"newsletter option-b-newsletter in-shortcode\">\n\t<div class=\"newsletter-row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-newsletter\">\n\t\t\t<form name=\"inline-newsletter-option-b\" class=\"newsletter-form\" novalidate>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-tagline\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"heading\">Keep up with everything Wirecutter from your inbox<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-options\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"default\" checked=\"checked\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Wirecutter Weekly:<\/strong> New reviews and picks, sent weekly\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-option\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"newsletter-list-id\" name=\"newsletter-list-id\" value=\"deals\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Deals We Love:<\/strong> The best deals we can find, sent daily\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-list\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease choose a newsletter to subscribe to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"newsletter-field-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label for=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Sign up for Wirecutter's Newsletter<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" class=\"newsletter-source\" value=\"optionB\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"email\" class=\"newsletter-field newsletter-email\" placeholder=\"name@example.com\" value=\"\" name=\"newsletter-sign-up\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\" class=\"newsletter-submit\">Subscribe<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"field-error field-error-email field-error-general\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat wasn't a valid email address.

I installed the accompanying app on my phone, answered dozens of questions about my habits, and began stepping on the Shapa twice a day, as the app mandates.<\/p>\n<p>Ariely\u2019s inclinations to bring the focus away from individual data points track with my own experience learning to be dispassionate about my literal weight. My obsession with scales took off in college. I was bad at feeding myself regular meals, so I\u2019d often have the majority of calories for the day in, say, a single pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, always unable to stop until I finished the whole thing. The next day, I\u2019d go to the YMCA, get on the scale\u2014I knew enough to keep the thing out of my own home\u2014and notice either a small dip in weight (and feel relief) or a jump in weight (and feel terrible). I\u2019d exercise and then get back on the scale again a whopping hour later to assess my \u201cprogress.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The other problem is that I hated my weight. When my therapist suggested I had habits and accompanying thought patterns that represented disordered eating (I never threw up after binging, but not for lack of trying), I felt heard and relieved. She signed me up for group therapy, a weekly session with a dietician, and a regular appointment with a scale in her office.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\"><div class=\"title\">Pull Quote<\/div><p>My obsession with scales took off in college.<\/p><\/aside>\n<p>The idea with that scale was for me to learn to treat my weight like any other metric about myself, such as my height or age. (The concept that one\u2019s weight stays within a general range despite even solid efforts to change it is called <a href=\"https:\/\/medical.mit.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/set_point_theory.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set-point theory<\/a> [PDF].) My therapist kept a log of my weight with a little arrow or dash next to each number: up, down, up, up, up, down, the same. And so on. We\u2019d start the session off talking about how it made me feel. At first: \u201cBad.\u201d \u201cTriumphant.\u201d \u201cTriumphant.\u201d \u201cMeh.\u201d \u201cBad.\u201d But then: \u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ve been doing this for weeks, I am kind of used to it?\u201d I even learned not to hate the underlying number\u2014about 160 pounds\u2014itself.<\/p>\n<p>Last spring I set up a line of scales in my bathroom to test for <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-smart-scales\/\">Wirecutter\u2019s guide<\/a>. My roommate came home to find me marching on and off them. \u201cI\u2019m bored!\u201d I declared. Once, it would have felt like walking a tightrope.<\/p>\n<p>While the Shapa does away with weight in numbers, the goal is decidedly not dispassion toward weight as a concept. Ariely made the scale to address obesity, and he has measured its success in pounds lost. In a 12-week pilot study with 645 participants, Ariely found that participants who used the Shapa (app and all) lost on average 0.61 percent of their weight per month (for a 200-pound person, that\u2019s 1.2 pounds for the first month), while the group of regular numerical-scale users <em>gained <\/em>0.91 percent. (Treat these numbers lightly: The study was not peer reviewed.) For rough comparison, in a study on (and also funded and designed by) Weight Watchers, <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/oby.21846\/full\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">participants lost about 2 pounds a month for three months<\/a> using the online program.<\/p>\n<p>However, the Shapa is far more expensive than other scale options. It costs $130 for the physical device, plus $10 a month for the subscription accompanying the app; for comparison, <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/best-smart-scales\/\">our top smart-scale pick<\/a>, the <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/24484\/0\/4\/70031\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eufy BodySense<\/a>, typically costs $50. That Eufy model charts out your body weight on a graph so you can see the overall trend and choose to respond to that rather than the number on any given day. (That concept is admittedly trickier than having the Shapa mask the figures for you.) The Shapa system is more comparable to something like Weight Watchers, which <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/24485\/0\/4\/70032\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">costs about $20 per month<\/a> for a basic online subscription, or about the same for one year once you factor in the price of the Shapa scale. (Due to overwhelming demand from participants in a pilot study, a future version of the Shapa will have the numerical weight buried somewhere in its app.)<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re committed to using the Shapa scale as part of a weight-loss program, it sends reminders. When I was about to miss a weigh in, the Shapa app sent a notification congratulating me on my streak so far and encouraging me to keep it up. I haven\u2019t seen anything else that will do the same thing (as seamlessly with the scale, at least\u2014it\u2019s easy to set up a daily reminder on your phone\u2019s calendar and track your habit with <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https:\/\/wclink.co\/link\/24486\/0\/4\/70033\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a free app<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Part of the way the Shapa system justifies its subscription cost is through a barrage of general health tips and push notifications from its app. The Shapa app gave me daily missions to help me eat less\u2014such as to drink more water, or use smaller plates at mealtimes\u2014or to simply continue engaging with the app and my ostensible goal of losing weight, like decluttering my room or sending a silly selfie to a friend. I lied and told the Shapa app that I decluttered my room, and it sent me a notification: \u201cYou are terrific\u201d followed by a heart-eyes emoji.<\/p>\n<p>The app\u2019s daily missions are not that beneficial, per Ariely\u2019s study: Participants who used the Shapa scale without them lost an average of 0.57 percent of their weight per month, essentially the same amount as the group that did receive them.<\/p>\n<p>While the notion of using smart features to focus on the value of body weight as a trend is a promising application of tech, the Shapa is still narrowly focused on the concept of losing weight, which cuts out potential owners who may want to maintain weight or even gain it. (The Shapa website currently suggests that the scale can accommodate all kinds of health goals, but the actual system accommodates only weight-loss goals for now.) For those people, the daily missions and reminders might even be counterproductive. Focusing singularly on weight as a metric of health isn\u2019t the best route even for obese people; losing weight and keeping it off can be monumentally challenging, and ultimately not as connected to healthy behaviors, even in the long term, as people might like. If someone\u2014no matter their size\u2014has perfected their diet and exercise routine to the point that they feel healthy, but they then see a light telling them to try harder when they weigh in, it might be discouraging. Likewise, someone could tumble down a rabbit hole of restrictive eating and exercise, cheered on by a blue light from the Shapa; being overweight by BMI standards doesn\u2019t preclude a person from developing an eating disorder.<\/p>\n<p>This problem is hardly unique to the Shapa. Even the best smart scales fail to give owners the ability to set\u2014and be supported by\u2014their own goals. For instance, you have no way to prevent the Eufy BodySense from displaying that your weight is \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d or \u201cexcessive\u201d based on your BMI, regardless of how the number fits into your overall health. Even with expanded goals, the Shapa won\u2019t be for everyone: Ultimately, the whole thing is about controlling your body, not observing it for what it is.<\/p>\n<p>Ariely knows weight isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all, and he has ambitions to expand the approach to other devices and metrics of health, including blood pressure and cholesterol. And his scale seems to be evolving on the issue, too: In a version of the app that I tried prior to the scale\u2019s launch, a bright green light from the scale indicated weight loss. Now, green corresponds with no change in weight. \u201cShapa is celebrating for the users even if they are just maintaining their weight,\u201d explain the press materials.<\/p>\n<p>As it is, the Shapa is too narrowly focused to be useful for anyone who isn\u2019t trying to lose weight, and it\u2019s possibly damaging to anyone who has anxieties about their weight. Even if it weren\u2019t, a subscription would be hard to justify. On top of that, the Shapa scale takes three weeks of twice-daily weigh-ins to calibrate to your weight. After weeks and many weigh-ins, I still failed to use the Shapa consistently enough to even calibrate it. Even though the current device misses the mark, Ariely is on to something in making tech that looks beyond the fine-grained data toward something more meaningful.<\/p>\n",

Don\u2019t make any fitness changes at first,<\/strong> aside from putting the thing on and syncing it to your phone. Take a week to get used to how the device works (more on that coming up), but don\u2019t change anything about your movement habits. This approach will let you capture a baseline in terms of where you are now, so you can set targeted and personalized goals. You\u2019ll also get some real satisfaction later in being able to see your improvement from the start.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Familiarize yourself with your tracker\u2019s features.<\/strong> Learn about your tracker\u2019s capabilities, as well as its limitations. For example, many trackers have activity auto-detection to record walks, runs, bike rides, or swims, so your tracker may be able to tell that you went for a bike ride and give you credit for that in the app, but if you want to have an accurate record of the specific distance you traveled, you may need to choose, start, and stop a cycling workout setting to record your ride stats with greater detail. Many, if not most, fitness trackers also have move alerts to remind you to get up when you\u2019ve been still for a while (though mine often goes off in yoga class). And many now offer relaxation-focused guided-breathing activities, which can be great for reminding yourself to take a timeout when necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Get to know the app, too.<\/strong> You can find additional useful stuff in there apart from what you can do with the tracker, such as food diaries, goal-setting plans, and more. The app may also be how you change settings on the tracker, including setting your own max heart rate or stride length for improved accuracy, or creating a run-walk interval program that triggers the device to guide your workout.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Change one habit at a time.<\/strong> Once you have some baseline records of your activities, you have to decide what matters most. All the research on lasting lifestyle change suggests that you should not make a total overhaul. Instead, concentrate on incremental efforts. Pick one\u2014and only one\u2014goal that you want to focus on at a time, and work on it for at least a month consistently before adding a new one. Say your first goal is to spend less time sitting. In this case, your tracker&#8217;s step count or move alert becomes your top priority, and setting a goal to increase your step count by 10 to 15 percent over the baseline you established originally is a great start.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. That said, stop being obsessed with steps.<\/strong>\u00a0Chances are, you bought this thing for step counting, but <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/reviews\/the-best-fitness-trackers\/#a-word-on-step-count\">no fitness tracker is truly accurate as a pedometer<\/a>. More important, making improvements in your fitness includes movement of many kinds, from cardio to strength training to stretching. Too often, people get hung up on what the tracker tracks\u2014does the activity even <em>count<\/em> if it\u2019s not quantified?\u2014and lose sight of the bigger picture. Most trackers or their apps offer ways to log workouts or movement-based daily activities, such as hiking or biking, that aren\u2019t captured as readily as steps are. If it helps to motivate (or edify) you to have a log for those workouts or active sessions, use those features! Steps are not the only way to achieve fitness, and more steps are not always better; don\u2019t be afraid to introduce variety to your routine, even if your app doesn\u2019t credit you as much for that as it might do for thousands upon thousands of steps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Use your tracker in phases.<\/strong> If you find yourself getting bored with your new tracker or simply ignoring it entirely, even with its furtive pleas to get up and move, stop wearing it\u2014you don\u2019t want to associate it with annoyance. The same goes for becoming way too reliant on it, at the expense of rationality (if you\u2019ve ever frantically paced around your house at 11:58 p.m. to hit your day\u2019s step count, you know what I\u2019m talking about). You didn\u2019t buy the thing to make it your activity-policing Big Brother, nor do you want to let it become noise in your life to ignore. It\u2019s fine to use a tracker simply to check in with yourself from time to time and get on track, rather than as a shackle to enforce a rigid routine for eternity. Put it back on when you can focus on it again\u2014and maybe wear it on the opposite wrist, so it feels novel once more.<\/p>\n",

No cords to unspool or wrap up, no buttons to press and hold.
